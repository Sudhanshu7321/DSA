# The other applications of catalan numbers are :

# Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
# Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
# Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
# Number of ways a convex polygon of n+2 sides can split into triangles by connecting vertices.
# The number of paths with 2n steps on a rectangular grid from bottom left, i.e., (n-1, 0) to top right (0, n-1) that do not cross above the main diagonal.
